# LavaBlock

You start on a 25x25 tile landfill island surrounded entirely by lava. There are no ore patches, no trees, no water — just your starting equipment and a chemical plant. Everything has to come from the lava.

**Requires Space Age.**

## How it works

Instead of mining, you extract resources by processing lava in chemical plants:

- Lava → Stone / Coal / Iron Ore / Copper Ore
- Lava → Iron Plate / Copper Plate / Stone Bricks (unlocked via research)
- Lava + Coal → Steam → Crude Oil → everything downstream
- Stone + Sulfuric Acid → Uranium Ore
- Lava + Coal + Stone Bricks → Calcite

Electric mining drills are removed from the tech tree — they serve no purpose here.

Land is the other scarce resource. The only way to expand is by researching island expansion technologies, which grant landfill. Every tile matters.

## Science packs

LavaBlock adds several new science packs alongside the base game ones:

- **Lava Science Pack** — the core pack, crafted from lava-derived materials
- **Military Science Pack 2** — advanced military research using railgun ammo, tesla ammo, artillery shells, uranium, and electromagnetic plant
- **Circuit Science Pack** — electronics-focused pack using electronic circuits, advanced circuits, and processing units
- **XP Science Pack** — earned automatically through crafting; feeds into the XP Lab
- **Pyroclast Science Pack** *(Space Age)* — crafted on Pyroclast using obsidian, lava, and advanced electronics

## Pyroclast *(Space Age, WIP)*

Pyroclast is a hyper-volcanic planet reachable from Vulcanus. It has higher gravity and pressure than Vulcanus, and a completely lava-dominated landscape.

What's on Pyroclast:
- Minable volcanic rocks (huge and big variants) yielding stone and ores
- Sulfuric acid lakes — pumpable with offshore pumps
- Molten Iron Geysers and Molten Copper Geysers — extractable with offshore pumps; cluster size, frequency, and richness are adjustable in map generation settings
- Demolisher territories
- Obsidian — a volcanic glass mineral extracted from lava in chemical plants, used for Pyroclast Science Pack

The connection to Pyroclast runs from Vulcanus.

## Starting kit

- 1 chemical plant
- 1 solar panel
- 1 small electric pole
- Some iron gear wheels and pipes

Steam power research is unlocked at the start so you can get power running without needing coal first.
