# LavaBlock - Ultimate Island Survival Challenge

**Transform your Factorio experience into the ultimate survival challenge!** LavaBlock is a revolutionary mod that completely reimagines how you approach factory building by stranding you on a tiny 25x25 tile island surrounded by deadly lava, forcing you to bootstrap your entire industrial empire through innovative lava-based resource extraction.

## 🌋 Unique Starting Scenario

Forget everything you know about Factorio's abundant resource landscape. In LavaBlock, you begin on a small landfill island - a mere 625 tiles of safe ground - completely surrounded by a moat of lava that stretches 12.5 tiles in every direction. No ore patches, no trees, no water, no enemies. Just you, your starting equipment, and an ocean of molten rock that holds all the resources you'll ever need.

## 🏭 Revolutionary Resource System

**No Traditional Mining** - Electric drills are useless here. Instead, LavaBlock introduces an entirely lava-based economy powered by chemical plants:

### Basic Extraction Recipes:

- 🪨 **Lava to Stone**: 100 lava → 2 stone (3.2s process)
- ⚫ **Lava to Coal**: 100 lava → 2 coal (3.2s process)
- 🔧 **Lava to Iron Ore**: 100 lava → 2 iron ore (3.2s process)
- 🟠 **Lava to Copper Ore**: 100 lava → 2 copper ore (3.2s process)
- 🌳 **Wood Extraction**: Environmental wood generation (15s process)

### Advanced Lava Smelting (unlocked through research):

- 🔩 **Direct Iron Plates**: 100 lava → 2 iron plates (3.2s)
- 🟫 **Direct Copper Plates**: 100 lava → 2 copper plates (3.2s)
- 🧱 **Stone Bricks**: 100 lava → 2 stone bricks (3.2s)
- ♨️ **Steam Generation**: 5000 lava + 1 wood + 5 coal → 5000 units of 165°C steam

### Specialized Resources:

- 🛢️ **Oil Production**: Steam + coal → crude oil
- ☢️ **Uranium Extraction**: Stone + sulfuric acid → uranium ore
- 🏗️ **Calcite Synthesis**: 50,000 lava + 10 coal + 100 stone bricks → 10 calcite (for Space Age foundations)
## 🔬 Completely Reworked Technology Tree

LavaBlock doesn't just add recipes - it fundamentally restructures Factorio's technology progression:

### New Technology Lines:

- **Advanced Lava Smelting**: Multi-tier productivity bonuses for lava smelting (up to infinite research)
- **Enhanced Mining Productivity**: Boosts lava extraction efficiency instead of traditional mining
- **Calcite Processing Adaptation**: Unlocks when you craft offshore pumps
- **Island Expansion Research**: Your only way to gain more land!

### Disabled Technologies:

- Electric mining drills (completely removed - they're useless anyway)
- Various base game techs restructured for lava economy
## 🏝️ Strategic Island Expansion

Land is your most precious resource. The only way to expand beyond your starting 25x25 island is through research:

### Island Expansion Technology:

- Unlocks at various science tiers
- Grants 500 landfill per research tier (configurable)
- Multiple distribution strategies for multiplayer:
  - All to main player
  - Divided among online players
  - Replicated for each player

Every tile must be earned through scientific progress, making base planning absolutely critical.

## 🎮 Perfectly Balanced Starting Conditions

Your survival kit includes essential items carefully chosen for the lava environment:

- 1 Chemical plant (your lifeline for resource extraction)
- 1 Solar panel (clean, sustainable power)
- 1 Small electric pole (power distribution)
- Iron gear wheels and pipes (basic components)

The mod automatically unlocks steam power research and provides tutorial guidance to help you understand the unique mechanics.

## 🚀 Space Age Integration

When Space Age is installed, LavaBlock seamlessly integrates:

- Space platform thruster technology unlocks traditional mining equipment for space operations
- Foundation platform recipes enabled for space construction
- Full compatibility with expanded tech tree while maintaining island survival core

## 👥 Multiplayer Excellence

LavaBlock shines in multiplayer scenarios with configurable landfill distribution, balanced progression that prevents any single player from dominating, and cooperative resource management challenges that bring teams together.

## 🎯 Perfect For Players Who Love:

- **Extreme Resource Management**: Every resource matters when space is limited
- **Strategic Base Planning**: No room for mistakes in your factory layout
- **Alternative Progression**: Completely different from standard Factorio gameplay
- **Survival Challenges**: Bootstrap civilization from almost nothing
- **Long-term Optimization**: Infinite research ensures hundreds of hours of content
- **Cooperative Play**: Share the challenge with friends

## 🔧 Quality of Life Features

- Comprehensive English localization with clear recipe descriptions
- Custom recipe categorization under "Island Management" tab
- Visual feedback through custom lava-themed icons
- Configurable settings for different server sizes and preferences
- Crash site removal for cleaner starting experience
## 🌟 A Complete Game Mode Transformation

LavaBlock isn't just a mod - it's a complete reimagining of Factorio that maintains everything you love about factory building while introducing fresh challenges and mechanics. The carefully balanced resource conversion rates, innovative progression systems, and unique constraints create an experience that feels entirely new while remaining fundamentally Factorio.

Whether you're a seasoned factory veteran looking for a fresh challenge or a new player seeking a unique introduction to Factorio's mechanics, LavaBlock offers hundreds of hours of engaging, strategic gameplay that will test your engineering skills like never before.
