[lava-block]
on-start-mechanics-explanation-1=[img=info] Welcome to Lava Block! If you're not on a small island please return to the main screen and choose the "lava-block" map generation mode.
on-start-mechanics-explanation-2=[img=info] You can gather driftwood and create placeable infinite resource patches with the recipes in the "Island management" tab.
on-start-mechanics-explanation-3=[img=info] If you want to remove an ore patch to switch resource types then you can use the ore eraser tool (you may need to click on the 3 dots in the top-right of the toolbar to add the ore eraser to your quickbar).
on-start-mechanics-explanation-4=[img=info] The only way to get more landfill is through research. When this research completes the player who made the map will receive all of the landfill. If their inventory is full when the research completes then the excess landfill will be dropped on the ground.
on-start-mechanics-explanation-5=[img=info] If your starting island is made of landfill you can re-arrange it by clicking your hotbar and adding a landfill icon to it. This will let you mine landfill without bots, even if it's all placed.
