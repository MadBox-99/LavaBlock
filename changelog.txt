Version: 0.0.24
Date: 2025-12-23
  Changes:
    - Sulfur recipe rework: created planet-specific sulfur recipes
    - Nauvis uses new sulfur-lava recipe (petroleum gas + lava, no water required)

    - This fixes a bug where 3 fluid inputs were required but chemical plants only support 2
    - Water removal on Nauvis also serves as a balance buff since water is hard to produce
