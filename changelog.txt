Version: 0.0.8
Date: 2025-08-28
  Changes:
    - Fine tuned calcite synthesis recipe
    - Added new recipe for foundation crafting recipe on Nauvis productivity
    - More improvements to resource extraction efficiency
    - Faster progression in early game resource gathering
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.7
Date: 2025-08-27
  Changes:
    - Changed iron smelting recipe to be unlocked by automation and logistic science packs
    - Iron smelting recipe is no longer available at start, needs to be researched
    - Increased research cost of advanced lava smelting technology to 1000 science packs
    - Advanced lava smelting technology now requires automation and logistic science packs to research
    - Removed chemical, production, and utility science packs from advanced lava smelting technology prerequisites
    - Removed stone extraction recipe because it was to strong and easy to get stone
    - Now to get stone you need 1 iron ore and 1 copper ore to get 1 stone (same cost at it was before) + 1 processing step
    - Improved crafting requirements for advanced technologies
    - Calcite synthesis recipe now reduced cost and only craftable on Nauvis
  Major Features:
    - New technology tree for stone productivity for "ore clearing"
    - Now the calcite synthesis only craftable on Nauvis
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.6
Date: 2025-08-26
  Map Generation:
    - Improved island shape for more natural appearance
    - Now enemies also spawn and make expansion much harder
    - Many enemies spawn and they appear over a large area
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.3
Date: 2025-08-23
  Major Features:
    - Added steam generation recipe using lava
    - Added calcite synthesis recipe for can create foundation
  Features:
    - Steam generation recipe: 5000 units of lava produces + 1 wood + 5 coal produce 5000 units of steam 165 celsius
    - Calcite synthesis recipe: 50000 units of lava + 10 coal + 100 stone bricks produce 10 calcite at 165 celsius
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
